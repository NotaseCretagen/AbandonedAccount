# AbandonedAccount
I made this repo so I wouldn't have to edit my profile and have a github bot flag it as non-human and thus hide everything I've done on github, after I've logged out and abandoned this account. So this is to let anyone know, that I've abandoned this account. (deleted pwds and email so can't recover)
